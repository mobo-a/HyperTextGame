I chose this due to my love of games but also its educational benefits which relates to a hypertext game. Hypertext games have a huge potential for education due to it being an interactive functions and aspects. Another reason in which I chose to do a hypertext game is due to my love and passion for games and the ability in which a hypertext game gives you. Since young I would say I have always been a game addict and now with the opportunity of making one, it opens a whole new field which allows me to develop a unique and innovative game which is one of the first of its kind with it being for educational purposes.
