    The day starts another normal boring day at the office, My Boss Novak Richardson still doesn't trust me , meaningless stories after meaningless stories.
    <br>
    Financial Crisis,Prostitution , Banks and Rogue Police Force.
    <br>
    Thats not the type of news journalist i am , i want to cover murder, theft , burglary , arson the whole shibang.
    <br>
    The good , the bad and the ugly.
    <br>
    However he insists i am not ready and need to build myself up but what he doesn't know is that i am better than half of these journalists he has on the roster.
    <br>
    They are all pigs and snobs who suck up to the person with the most money.
    <br>
    A corrupt system with corrupt people in it.
